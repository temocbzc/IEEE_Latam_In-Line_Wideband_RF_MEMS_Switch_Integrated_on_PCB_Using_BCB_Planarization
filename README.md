#### Instructions to reproduce the device

The fabrication process flow for the proposed RF-MEMS swithc is shown in the next picture.

**Instructions:**

1. Etch the copper clad of the microwave-friendly substrate to reduce its thickness form 17 to 11 $\mu$m to obtain a better resolution in the subsequent steps (Fig 1 (a)).
2. Pattern to form the central conductor and the ground planes of the CPW, as well as the actuation electrode of the switch (Fig 1 (b)).
3. Decap the area of the actuation electrode by etching 1$\mu$m of copper (Fig 1 (c)).
4. Fill it with 5$\mu$m of BCB (Down 4024-40), require a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s, pattern and etched-off to form the anchor (Fig 1 (d)). 
5. Fill it with 1$\mu\m of BCB (Down XU-35133), require a speed of 3500 rpm for 30 s, pattern and etched-off to cover the actuation electrode (Fig 1 (e)).
6. The UV exposition was adequate to initially polymerize de BCB. Then the BCB film have to cure at a temperature of 210 C for 40 min.
7. Deposit and pattern positive photoresist (AZ9245) as sacrificial layer (Fig 1 (f)). 
8. Deposit 1$\mu$m-thick copper film using RF sputtering technique .
9. Pattern and etch to form the switch membrane (Fig 1 (g)).
10. Release th structure using a supercritical dryer.

NOTE: The etching-copper process is using an etchant based on hydrogen peroxide/hidrochloric acid/water solution. For 4 s remove 1$\mu$m-thick of cooper.

The data sheets of BCB and photoresist are added in this repository.
